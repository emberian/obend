# Obend.Consensus.SimplexProtocol — the honest-node relation, the adversary, and chain consistency

`Obend.Consensus.Simplex` proves quorum lemmas over abstract predicates and says in its header that
it holds no protocol. This module is the protocol, as a relation (2026-11-04):

- A CHAIN has one entry per view, oldest first: the block the view notarized, or the view's dummy
  (`Entry`, `Chain`). Its height is its number of blocks.
- A MESSAGE is a sender, a view, a kind (`propose`, `vote`, `finalize`) and a target: a block,
  named by the whole chain it ends, or a view's dummy. The global state is the list of messages
  ever sent (`Sent`); an honest node's own state is read from its own messages, so "vote once per
  view" needs no other field.
- The ADVERSARY is `Step.inject`: any message whose sender the `Protocol` marks faulty. Honest
  steps are `propose` (the view's leader), `vote` (once per view; for a block only if the block
  extends a chain whose every entry is notarized) and `finalize` (only a block the node voted for
  in that view and has seen notarized). `Reach` closes the steps from the empty message list.
- `Inv` is what every reachable message list satisfies (`reach_inv`); the theorems below take
  `Inv` and the `Protocol`'s bounds (`committee.length = 3f+1`, at most `f` faulty, `Nodup`).

What is proved, all from `Simplex.honest_quorum_intersection`:
- `notarized_block_unique`: one view notarizes one block.
- `finalized_no_dummy`: a view that finalized a block did not notarize its dummy.
- `finalized_prefix_of_notarized`: a finalized chain is a prefix of every notarized chain that
  reaches its view; hence `finalized_consistent` (two finalized chains, one is a prefix of the
  other) and `fin_cert_unique_per_height` (two finalized chains of one height carry the same
  blocks).
- `accountable`: two conflicting quorums in one view name at least `f+1` signers, each with its
  two votes in the message list, which `SlashingReceipt.checks` re-reads; none of them kept the
  vote-once rule, and under the fault bound each is faulty (`signers_faulty`).

What is not here: liveness, timers, signatures (a message's sender is taken as its signer), and
the executable node. `Obend.Consensus.SimplexTrace` decides whether a recorded run was a sequence
of these steps (`checkTrace_sound`), and `crates/obend-node/src/net.rs` records its run as that
trace; the node casts one vote per view and finalizes only after a quorum of votes.

`Obend.Consensus.Simplex.State` is not used: it is a per-node fragment of a five-kind protocol
(`candidate`, `ready`) that is not this one, and nothing there is needed once the state is the
message list.
