/- Executable annotation preparation for `Bidirectional.checkAgainst`.

`prepare` walks an erased term in the checker's own modes and produces an
`AnnotationTree` for exactly the positions the checker cannot fill from its
expected type: a lambda in function position (a let-redex), an introduction form
in synthesis position, a `fix` whose specification is a bare lambda, a record
checked against a row whose members sit behind an alias or a row tail, an
application whose function type is a specification over an alias. Everything it
annotates it infers locally, from the expected type, the context and the types it
predicts for the subterms; it predicts exactly the type the checker will
synthesize, because each branch below computes it the same way `elaborate` does.

A caller may pass `hints`, an annotation map in the checker's own convention (the
front end's packet annotations). A hint at a lambda, injection, `perform` or
`done` is kept; preparation adds annotations only where there is none.

Preparation is not trusted: `prepareChecked` runs `checkAgainst` on the result,
so a wrong prediction is a refusal, never an acceptance. `prepare_checks`
(`Obend.Elab.PrepareChecks`) proves that on the fragment `Checkable` with
alias-free assumptions, every `Typed` term is prepared and accepted. Where local
inference is silent (a lambda, injection, `perform`, `done` or empty `case` in
synthesis position with no hint), `prepareSearch` tries a bounded set of
candidate annotations at the named path and rechecks; exhaustion is a refusal
that names the path and the number of candidates tried, never "untypable". -/
