/-! ## The forced checkpoint can be larger than the unforced one

Collection never grows a state, and settling never changes its size; forcing can. A
Plan that is a small closure over a cell the continuation also holds becomes, forced,
the whole structure that closure computes, all of it live. Here the Plan reads cell 0,
a suspended record of three fields; the stack holds cell 0 too. Unforced and collected:
two cells. Forced, settled and collected: five (cell 0's record, the Plan cell and the
three field cells, all reachable from the stack through cell 0). So under heap limits
counted from zero a resumed forced checkpoint may run out of heap where the unforced one
would not (`Kernel.ObjectiveResumeContract.absolute_limits_refuted`); the kernel counts a
segment's limits from its own heap end (`limitsPast`, `Kernel.ObjectiveActivity.
segmentLimits`), under which it resumes exactly (`ObjectiveResumeContract.
largerYield_resumes_exactly`, `runSegment_stored_complete`). -/
