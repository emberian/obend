/- The checker's transport theorems, stated of `Bidirectional.checkAgainst`: substitution
(`checkAgainst_msubst`) and template instantiation (`Discharges.checkAgainst_instantiate`). Each is
the relation-level theorem (`TypedSubstitution.checked_msubst`, `Templates.Discharges.partialTyping_instantiate`)
followed by annotated completeness (`BidirectionalCompleteness.annotated_complete`): the transported
term is accepted by the checker under prepared annotations, at the transported type, with the
transported uses.

Why prepared annotations and not the original ones carried along. The fuel checker's
`infer_instantiate` kept the template's annotations, instantiated: `infer` only asks `agree` yes or
no and keeps its own synthesized type. The bidirectional checker does not: an elimination form's
ascription (`Bidirectional.ascribe`) takes the annotation's type when it agrees with the synthesized
one and keeps the synthesized one otherwise, and the two then drive different weak-head forms and
row lookups downstream. A rigid `Self` makes that branch move under instantiation: `variable Self`
and its bound row disagree in the template (rigid, never an alias) and the instance row and the
instantiated bound may agree, so the instance's run takes a branch the template's never took. No
statement of the form "the instantiated annotations are accepted" follows from the template's run;
acceptance under re-prepared annotations does, for every instance. The substitution theorem is in
the same position: the filled term's annotations are the template's around the fillings' own, and a
filling's ascriptions meet a context they were not checked in. -/

/-- **The substitution lemma for the checker.** A term the checker accepts in `Ψ` at `A`, with every
filling `σ` names closed, sharing the term's assumptions, and accepted in `Ψ` at exactly the type `Ψ`
declares for its hypothesis, gives `msubst σ t` accepted in `Ψ` at `A` under prepared annotations, with
pointwise no more uses of any hypothesis than `t` had. -/

of its bound the checker accepts it; with `Self` rigid it refuses it. -/

-- fixture kept (2026-11-04): refusal witness: `checkAgainst` says no to a forged/ill-formed input; no soundness theorem shows a checker can refuse
