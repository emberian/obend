/- The bidirectional checker for Core4, beside `Obend.Core.Check`.

`synthAt` infers a type for a term; `checkAt` checks a term against an expected type.
Both recurse on the term (no fuel), return `Except CheckRefusal`, and carry the
declarative derivation (`PartialTyping`), so soundness is by construction as in
`Check.check`. Conversion happens only where synthesis meets an expected type: the
mode switch (`checkAt` of an elimination form), an expected type's head unfolded to
weak-head form (`whnf`), and a join (`ifBool`, `ifZero`, `case` in synthesis, which
synthesize one branch and check the rest against it). Usage vectors are synthesized
bottom-up exactly as the relation computes them.

Representative annotations are used in both modes. In synthesis: a lambda's (`LambdaAnnotation`), an
injection's (its codomain is the sum, or an alias of it, `injectionHead`), a `perform`'s (plan and response), a `done`'s
(plan and response), and, anywhere else, an ascription (its codomain): an
introduction form checks against it, an elimination form takes it when it agrees
with what was synthesized and otherwise keeps its own type. An `extend` takes its
target's representative from the annotation's domain and its fields' row from the
codomain. Checking prefers a present representative annotation and then converts
to the requested type. Missing annotations retain expected-directed behavior.
Eliminations may use annotation.domain as their operand representative; mix uses
domain for the lower operand and codomain for the upper operand. -/
