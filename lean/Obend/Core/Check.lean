/-! ### Row lookup bounded by a visited set instead of fuel

The relation keeps `∃ fuel` (`PartialTyping.get`, `.extend`, `.inject`); a successful
lookup never passes the same bounded variable twice (it would loop), so a walk that
refuses a revisited variable finds exactly what some fuel finds
(`lookupV_iff`, `isRowV_iff`). The bidirectional checker uses these. -/
